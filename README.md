# Simple Weapons (Half-Life 2 Extended)
An addon for [Simple Weapons](https://github.com/TankNut/simple-weapons) that adds extra Half-Life 2 themed weapons.

Model files aren't included since they're binary files and register as having changed even when compiled with the exact same source files. Either compile them yourself from the included source files or extract the workshop version.
